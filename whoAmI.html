      <hr>
      <p>
        November 26, 2000. That is the day I came into the world and for as long as I can
        remember I have always had a strong passion towards all technology. I was born and raised in the
        capatial of Alberta, Canada.. Edmonton. I grew up in the city and I will forever love the busy city life.
        I lived in Edmonton up until grade 6 where I went to a couple different schools such as St. Elizabeth and
        James Gibbons. With me being a city person I was not the happiest in grade 7 when we moved and I had to go
        to Pigeon Lake Regional School. That lasted a year and the rest of my childhood expierence was finished in
        High Prairie where I attended Prairie River Junior High School and later on E.W. Pratt High School. After
        highschool I quickly moevd back to the busy city of Edmonton to go to university. At first I was very undecided
        on what I wanted to go to school for and origionally I decided to go to Concordia University of Edmonton for
        a music degree. It took a little but but eventually I decided to stick with my long lasting passion of technology
        and persue an education in some form of computer science.

      <h2>My life (currently)</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Currently I am enrolled in a Bachelor of General Studies Degree through Athbasca University.
        I try to always be enrolled in 3-4 courses at a time and I believe I am doing ok in my university journey.
        Online courses are much more difficult for me but thats because I procrastanite way too much, in the end I get
        everything done that I can but it does get stressfull.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school I am the ordinary broke university student that most people can probably imagine. Im lucky to have a
        very supportive family and a great girlfriend who helps me remember there is more to life than just school. I also have a
        PitBull dog named Hazel and she is the sweetest animal ever.
